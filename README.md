# Terminal Coffee Shop Web App

A web application for a coffee shop, built as a college end term web development project and as a scrappy test/dev mode entry for the [Terminal Coffee Shop](https://www.terminal.shop/) API contest.

## Purpose
This project was developed as part of my college's end term web development course.

It is also a test/dev mode submission for the Terminal Coffee Shop API contest, which invites participants to create unique and creative ways to buy coffee using their open API.

The app is focused on rapid prototyping and creative integration, rather than being a fully polished production solution.
